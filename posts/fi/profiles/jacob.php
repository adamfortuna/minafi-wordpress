  <h3>Jacob from <a href="https://earlyretirementextreme.com/" target="_blank">Early Retirement Extreme</a></h3>
  <p class="lead">41m, married, retired in Chicago. <i>Enough</i> in savings and spending $11k/yr (<$7k/person). FI by 30. RE at 33 in a city metro.</p>
  <p>
    Renaissance man and an intellectual gunslinger with an attention span of 3-5 years. I enjoy thinking about hard interdisciplinary problems and finding practical solutions. I've worked with problems in nuclear astrophysics, energy resources, sustainability, algorithmic trading, and extreme FIRE.

    <h4>How did you learn about FI?</h4>
    <p>
      The rudimentary concepts of FI aren't exactly rocket science, so I largely figured it out on my own before I realized there was an actual term (FI) for it. In 2000/01, I started reading different websites that questioned hyperconsumption, the debt-based financial system, and the sustainability of natural resources. At the time, I had two goals: 1) Living with a very low ecological footprint (see Mathis Wackernagel); 2) Save enough money to buy a house without needing a mortgage.
    </p>
    <p>
      At some point I read RDPD's cashflow quadrant book (one of the few books available to me from the library at the time) and learned about the idea of using investment-income instead of job-income to make a living. Since I already had $100k saved, I hacked up a small fortran program to see when my capital income would exceed my expenses so I no longer depended on a job.---And realized I was almost there already. I had also heard about YMOYL, so I knew low cost living was possible in practice, but I hadn't actually read the book yet.
    </p>

    <h4>What was your financial status when you began?</h4>
    <p>Before I decided to lower my footprint and save to buy a home, I always had around $0-1,000 in my savings account (no debt) being in the habit of spending all my savings on new tech gadgets. Quitting my useless gadget addiction cold turkey meant it was easy to save more than 80% of my stipend. A sustainable lifestyle costs very little! As a result, I had nearly $100k saved when I finally graduated (PhD). </p>

    <h4>What has been the most impactful change you've made towards FI?</h4>
    <p>Always question the prevailing paradigm! Feynman (one of the gods of physics) insisted that insight was best achieved by working out the solution to a problem on your own rather than studying other people's solutions.</p>

    <p>During the 2000s, the conventional dogma stipulated or rather demanded that early retirement was reserved for high-income millionaires; that it was easier to make more money than to spend less; that spending less meant "doing without or learning long lists of frugality tricks; and that being officially retired required one to permanently renounce any and all kinds of income.</p>

    <p>When I did the math and graphs showing the highly nonlinear relationship between early retirement and high savings rates. I published it in 2010 and it has since been copied many times by other bloggers. I used the Pareto Principle (as popularized in the 4HWW) focusing on the biggest costs of housing, driving, and eating instead of the long tail of frugality tips and tricks that mostly follow the same overall principles anyway (think "reduce, reuse, recycle"). We moved into an RV before it was the cool thing to do. I began to deliberately design my lifestyle using systems theory concepts realizing that if activities were valued for their productive potential, it should be possible to spend very little and even make money almost automagically.  Of course, the Internet Retirement Police did not approve of anyone calling  themselves retired when they still accepted money here and there from multiple sources but to me it seemed crazy for anyone (under 99 years of age) to refuse all future income out of principle. Why refuse money? Why be unproductive? Look at Steve Jobs, who didn't need to work but still did it anyway: Why don't all humans do this albeit on a smaller scale when it's completely possible? I don't know.
    </p>

    <h4>What, if anything, do you wish you could have done differently?</h4>
    <p>When breaking trail/mapping out the territory, it's hard to know where to go, because you're always learning as you go along. This is similar to doing research trying to answer questions not yet  knowing what the questions are. Research is the proverbial 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration, but I find it personally interesting not just theoretically but also practically, so I try to experience things by living them as much as possible.</p>

    <p>I wrote the ERE book (2008-2010) to provide the intellectual ammunition and map for metaphorical  lieutenants and sergeants to teach future soldiers. I think most [soldiers] prefer the ""I did it and so can you""-type stories and books latching onto leaders they want to follow and be like. These stories are what generates mass appeal when it comes to outreach. I'm happy to see so many practical examples now and how those unconventional ideas that were considered crazy and unrealistic ten years ago are now commonly accepted in the FIRE community.</p>

    <h4>What advice do you have for others going down the path of FI?</h4>
    <p>One of the concepts that hasn't been widely adopted is the web of goals concept. It still seems commonly believed that the only way to radically lower expenses is through simple living and deliberately doing without and "sacrificing". Web-of-goals is a systems theoretical concept that ties together all one's assets, skills, and resources by looking at each of them as a potential input and a potential output to each other. By "closing the loops" between them, expenses can be lowered by increasing complexity to maintain the same output. Under the consumer-paradigm, expenses indicates "standard of living" because you get what you pay for. Whereas under the web of goals paradigm, spending is only used to reduce friction, so here you get according to your design skill level.</p>

    <p>It's advanced stuff but I think it's worth looking because lower expenses will shave years off from one's FI projections and increase one's safety to adverse economic conditions. I think if it was widely adopted, we'd see a lot more FIRE blogs where spending is under $15,000/year/household.</p>
